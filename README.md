# hello-world

A big smile to whoever is seeing this file.

I am a student now learning some programming languages. Java and Python are my tools to kick off this amazing game. I have grasped the knowledge of Github is the most convenient place where people can upload their codes to communicate with each other, I want to be a part of it, and I guess I am doing it.

Wish me the best journey toward a successful programmer and future engineer!
